mealtime
========

This is a CLI application to various "daily dish" restaurants, because...yes, I am that lazy.

Currently pulling delicious dishes from... :
* Arizmendi Bakery/Pizzeria (Piedmont/Oakland)
* Cheese Board [Pizza] Collective (Berkeley)
* Naked Lunch (San Francisco)

The next version of the gem will include food truck locations, and a couple more frequented restaurants. Stay tuned!

Feel free to install the gem by `gem install mealtime` and it is available on RubyGems [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/mealtime). Currently supported on Ruby 1.9.2 implementations.
